# CISC204-Walking-Sim
# This basic walking sim includes an environment with several walls where the player is free to walk around.
# Controls are as follows: WASD/Arrow Keys to move, Mouse to look around, Space to jump, Left Shift to toggle sprint.
# I know the requirements say the player object "cannot move outside of the walled space", but there is technically an intended way to escape. Hopefully that remains within the spirit of the assignment, as it is intended as more of an Easter egg and less of an "oops the player has no collision with the walls". All walls function properly as walls.
